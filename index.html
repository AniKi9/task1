                    <h1 class="title">Nirvana's Nevermind</h1>
                    <p class="text">Nirvana‘s Nevermind remains one of the most 
                        exhilarating and pivotal albums of all time. Not only 
                        did the LP serve as the band’s own breakthrough; it also 
                        helped to usher in grunge and alternative rock as the 
                        dominant sounds on radio and MTV. Moreover, this hook-filled 
                        yet blisteringly intense burst of punk alienation introduced 
                        Kurt Cobain as the reluctant voice of a generation, a mantle 
                        that may have paved the way for his tragic end three years 
                        later.
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="text">
                        The band’s rapid rise combined with Cobain’s wariness of fame 
                        much lore and mythology surrounding the iconic album, which was 
                        recorded over the course of a year with producer Butch Vig in 
                        both Wisconsin and Los Angeles. With more than 24 million copies 
                        sold worldwide, Nevermind continues to be a generation- and 
                        border-spanning favorite. 
                        Here are 5 things you might not know 
                        about Nirvana’s explosive masterpiece.
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="text">
                        <b>1. Nirvana began recording the songs in 1990 with Butch Vig for 
                        a planned second Sub Pop release.</b>
                        The band began work on their follow-up to debut album Bleach more 
                        than a year before its 
                        official release. After being connected with Vig by Sub Pop co-founder 
                        Bruce Pavitt, the band recorded six songs with the producer for what 
                        was meant to be a second album on their independent label. At the time, 
                        and due to Nirvana’s increasing success after touring with Sonic Youth, 
                        Sub Pop was shopping around the idea of gaining a distribution deal with 
                        a major label. In Wisconsin with Vig, Nirvana recorded several early 
                        versions of songs like “Lithium” and “Polly” that would eventually make 
                        the album, which would later be finished in Los Angeles at Sound City 
                        after the band inked its major-label deal.

                    <p class="text">
                        <b>2. The album’s original title was Sheep.</b>
                        While he retained his punk ethos after the band hit it big, 
                        Cobain was well aware of Nirvana’s potential to become one of the 
                        biggest acts in the world. Playing into that idea, he originally called 
                        the band’s sophomore effort Sheep, which was based off an inside joke 
                        about how the masses would flock to their album. He even mocked up a 
                        fake advertisement with the slogan “Because you want to not; because 
                        everyone else is” and fa ake but prophetic biography of the band that 
                        “cited” them as “Two times on the cover of Bowling Stoned, hailed as 
                        the most original, thought-provoking and important band of our decade 
                        by Thyme and Newsweak.”  
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="text">
                        <b>3. Vig convinced Cobain to double-track his vocals because 
                        “John Lennon did it.”</b>
                        Despite its rougher edges, Nevermind boasts a sculpted, 
                        accessible feel: Cobain’s double-tracked vocals, for example, 
                        added heft to the songs and fullness to his lurching howls. Vig’s 
                        decision double-track the vocals was inspired by late Beatles 
                        producer George Martin, and John Lennon’s use of the technique 
                        was what convinced Cobain to feel comfortable with it. “He was 
                        reluctant to do so because he thought it sounded too fake,” Vig 
                        recalled in a recent tribute to Martin following his passing earlier 
                        this year. After the producer brought up the Lennon connection, 
                        Cobain “pretty much double-tracked all the vocals after that.”

                    <p class="text">
                        <b>4. Hidden track “Endless, Nameless” was accidentally 
                        left off initial pressings of the album.</b>
                        “Endless, Nameless” was born from a frustrating recording session of 
                        “Lithium” where Cobain struggled to get his guitar parts correct. 
                        In the end, Vig decided to keep the noisy, aggressive recording 
                        and the band intended to tack it on to the end of the album as a 
                        hidden track following 10 minutes of silence once ballad 
                        “Something in the Way” wrapped. Howie Weinberg, the engineer 
                        who mastered the album, later noted that the decision to add 
                        “Endless, Nameless” had been a verbal one, contributing to his 
                        misunderstanding of the instructions. The song was re-added later.
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="text">
                        <b>5. Cobain was “embarrassed” by the final mix of Nevermind.</b>
                        Nirvana brought in Andy Wallace, who had previously worked 
                        with Slayer, to do the album’s final mix. As noted by both 
                        Wallace and Vig, the band had nothing but compliments and love 
                        for Wallace’s work upon initially hearing the final versions 
                        of the songs. Cobain’s tune in particular changed dramatically 
                        once the album’s sales skyrocketed, with the musician deeming 
                        himself “embarrassed” by the final product during interviews 
                        with biographer Michael Azerrad. “It’s such a perfect mixture 
                        of cleanliness and nice, candy production. … It may be 
                        extreme to some people who aren’t used to it, but I think it’s 
                        kind of lame, myself.”
